Snerp Vortex is an anagram of SVN Exporter.  It aims to be a faster,
more reliable way to convert repositories from Subversion to Git than
using git-svn and various abandonment techniques.

I started this project because the svn-to-git methods I'd read about
and tried were slow and produced unsatisfying results.

Snerp Vortex replays a Subversion repository dump into a local
directory, creating a new repository snapshot at each revision.  It
will then perform some not-Subversion's repository action, such as
"git commit -a".  The end result is a new repository with the
significant history of the old one.

"Significant" because some Subversion changes (such as property
changes) don't map to other systems.

Usage is simple.  At this stage, don't.  It doesn't work.  But it
should be fairly hackable, if you know Perl and Moose.

Special note for Mac OS X users:  Get yourselves a case-sensitive
filesystem.  This is easier done than said.  Disk Utility can create
empty random-access disk images with the filesystems of your choice.
They mount in /Volumes and are accessible like any other filesystem.
I'm using a 500MB one for testing.
